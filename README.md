# sassjs-loader

A webpack loader for [sass.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass.js).

## Why would I want to use this?
Honestly, you probably don't, and should use [sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader) instead. This is only good for people who can't use [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass). Perhaps your corporate firewall blocks the node-sass executable binary, or perhaps it won't run on your system.
